## 🔍 How It Works

2. **Model Training** – A classification model was trained using `Scikit-learn` and relevant face recognition features.
3. **Web Integration** – Built using `Flask` for the backend and `HTML/CSS/JS` for a snappy frontend.
4. **Prediction** – The model returns the name of the detected sportsperson with confidence.
